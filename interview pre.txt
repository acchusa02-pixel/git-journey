Sales Cloud is Salesforce’s CRM platform focused on helping sales teams manage leads, opportunities, accounts, and forecasting, while Service Cloud is designed for customer support teams to handle cases, provide omnichannel service, and build stronger customer relationships.

Every object in Salesforce (whether standard like Account or custom) follows a consistent schema pattern:

1. Object Definition

Label: Human-readable name shown in the UI.

API Name: Used in Apex, SOQL, and integrations (e.g., Account.Name).

2. Fields
Each object contains fields that store data:

Standard Fields: Predefined by Salesforce (e.g., Name, CreatedDate, OwnerId).

Custom Fields: Added by admins/developers (e.g., Region__c, Customer_Type__c).

Field Types:

Text, Number, Date/Time, Picklist, Lookup, Checkbox, Formula, etc.

System Fields (always present):

Id (unique record identifier)

CreatedById, CreatedDate

LastModifiedById, LastModifiedDate

3. Relationships
Objects are connected through relationships:

Lookup Relationship – Links one object to another (e.g., Contact → Account).

Master-Detail Relationship – Parent-child dependency (e.g., Opportunity Line Item → Opportunity).

Many-to-Many Relationship – Achieved via junction objects (e.g., Campaign Member links Campaigns and Leads/Contacts).

4. Metadata & Behavior
Record Types – Allow different business processes within the same object (e.g., different Opportunity stages for B2B vs B2C).

Page Layouts – Control how fields are displayed to users.

Validation Rules – Ensure data quality.

Triggers/Flows – Automate logic when records are created/updated.

5. Security & Sharing
Profiles & Permission Sets – Define who can view/edit fields.

Org-Wide Defaults (OWD) – Control baseline record visibility.

Role Hierarchy & Sharing Rules – Fine-tune access.




A service process is the end-to-end flow that customer service teams follow to handle inquiries, complaints, or requests. In Service Cloud, this process is highly customizable and powered by automation, AI, and real-time data.

1. Case Creation
Customers raise issues via email, phone, chat, social media, web forms, or Experience Cloud portals.

A Case record is created with details like subject, description, priority, and contact info.

2. Case Assignment
Cases are routed using:

Omni-Channel: Real-time routing based on agent availability.

Skills-Based Routing: Assigns cases to agents with matching expertise.

Assignment Rules: Based on criteria like region, product, or priority.

3. Case Investigation
Agents review case details, contact the customer, and gather more information.

They may collaborate internally using Chatter or escalate if needed.

4. Knowledge Article Reference
Agents use Knowledge Articles to find solutions.

Articles can also be shared with customers via email or portals.

5. Entitlement & SLA Tracking
Entitlements define what support the customer is eligible for.

Milestones track SLA targets like first response or resolution time.

6. Case Resolution
Once resolved, agents update the case status and resolution notes.

May involve sending confirmation emails or updating related records.

7. Feedback & Closure
Customers may receive a survey to rate their experience.

Case is marked Closed, and data is used for reporting and analytics.
