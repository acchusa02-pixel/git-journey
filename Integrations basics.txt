Ways of communication

Outbound: If salesforce needs some data from SAP, Hence
Salesforce Initiates the request.

As we are salesforce developers , from our perceptive it is
Outbound Integration.


Scenario 1 : Call External System from Salesforce using Rest
Callout

If Salesforce wants some data it initiates request hence
it is called outbound integration by callout.

Things required for Callout.
Authorization-> External System needs to provide us. Their
team will give this
||
Api Details
*Endpoint Url
*Get/post/put/patch/delete
*Request body
*Response
Add Externam sys to Named credentials/Remote Site settings
(Salesforce end after recieving the setup).

Template for Rest callout

Http http = new Http();
HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
req.setEndpoint('https://');
req.setMethod('Post');
req.setHeader('Content-Type','application/json;charset=UTF-8');
req.setBody();//json or xml

HttpResponse res = http.send(req);


Rest - Support both XMl and json structure, Soap only xml.
Rest is stateless,faster,json and xml(Representational State transfer)
Soap is stateful,slow,xml,secure(Simple Object Access Protocol)

Soap - External system will create a class , we need to get it

and go to apex classes and generate WSDL and go through the class
and call the method.

Inbound Integration

Standard Rest Api: For any Insert/Delete/Update/Query opp
on any salesforce Object, Salesforce offers API(These are 
called Standard APIs). Donot write Custom Apis for these kind
of scenarios. These api are available in Both Rest and Soap calls.

Call In
Create user for external user and share it with them
Share our api details
endpoint url
get/post/put/patch/delete
request body
response
create connected app

Standard api:

https://MyDomainName.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v61.0
/sobjects/Account/00893e89829eu

Salesforce domal address and Service resource which is responsible
for Query account.

To test the Inbound Integration we can try Postman.

How will you access to salesforce from External system
Outh
1.User name /Password
2.Client Id/Client Secrete

Outh is Industry standards to authenticate
Outh2 : Firstly External system sends username and password
Salesforce will generate Access tokem which is temporary id card
This token will be vaild for 1 hr only
then external system sends access token along with the request account.
Salesforce will hereback to accounts.

Here password is password + security token.

1st Postman should send username,password,client id and secrete to salesforce
which is Authorization API.

Authorization api is : Outhorizantion End point: https://hostname/services/oauth2/token
or u can use curl command which automatically creates the 
fields for username , password.

for the first time you will face the issue as invalid grant
so you need to enable one settings: Go to Oauth in quick fine
enable Allow Oauth username and password flows.

Once you get it paste the token 

beside to bearer in authorization field in postman.
if it doesn't work check with version of api and change to 15 digit id from 18
