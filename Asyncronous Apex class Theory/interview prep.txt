Overview about my project

I worked in an life science salesforce project on sales cloud for abbott for over 2.5 years. I worked for an application about abbott 
diabetic products. The application gives business insights on the consumers(patient) data to help the marketing
cloud to run their compaigns. This application recieves data from vaious country of the apac region through the 
integration into the staging objects and they are consolidated to single object through deduplication and merging rules
synched to single object through queuable apex ,triggers and flows. This object is utilized by the marketing cloud to run 
their campaign to know about the consumer demands and need based on which promotional emails are sent to order their product.


We were doing configuration level changes such as field creation , pagelayout
